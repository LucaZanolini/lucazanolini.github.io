I am a third-year PhD student in [Cryptology and Data Security](https://crypto.unibe.ch) at the University of Bern. My research interests include blockchains, distributed systems, consensus protocols and quorum systems. I graduated in Mathematics from [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en) with a thesis on Pairing-based Cryptography. During my PhD I am involved in teaching activities with Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/), my advisor: 

- In the fall semester of 2019 I was teaching assistant in the Cryptography course; 
- In the fall semester of 2020 I was teaching assistant in the Discrete Mathematics course;
- In the fall semester 2021 I was teaching assistant in the Privacy and Data Security course.

In summer 2021 I worked at [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com) as research intern.

Before joining the PhD, I worked for a year and a half in [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) as Blockchain developer. In that year I also received the certification as Ethereum developer from [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). 

During my working activities I program in **Solidity** and **Go**, and I have a basic knowledge of **Python**, **Javascript** and **Java**. 

I speak **Italian** (native), **English** (proficient) and **German** (beginner/intermediate).
