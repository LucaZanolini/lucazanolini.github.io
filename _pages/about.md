I am a third year PhD student in [Cryptology and Data Security](https://crypto.unibe.ch) at University of Bern. My research interests include blockchains, distributed systems, consensus protocols and quorum systems. I graduated in Mathematics from [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en) with a thesis on Pairing-based Cryptography.

Before joining the research group, I worked for a year and a half in [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) as Blockchain developer, where I received the certification as Ethereum developer from [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). During my PhD I am involved in teaching activities. In the fall semester of 2019 I was teaching assistant in the Cryptography course led by Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/), my advisor. In the fall semester of 2020 I was teaching assistant in the Discrete Mathematics course, always led by Prof. Cachin.
