I am a research scientist at the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/). My [research interests](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/265/5787.html) include **blockchains**, **distributed systems**, and **consensus** protocols. My present work centers on developing *dynamically available* consensus protocols. 

I hold a Ph.D. in [Cryptology and Data Security](https://crypto.unibe.ch) from the University of Bern, where I had the privilege of conducting impactful research with Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/). 

My primary focus during the Ph.D. has been on working on the model of *asymmetric trust* in distributed systems and blockchains. During my Ph.D. I have been involved in teaching activities:

- Fall 2019: Cryptography
- Fall 2020: Discrete Mathematics
- Fall 2021: Privacy and Data Security
- Fall 2022: Discrete Mathematics

In summer 2021 I worked at [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com) as a research intern.

My academic background is rooted in Mathematics, a discipline I studied at [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en).

Before joining the Ph.D., I worked for a year and a half at [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) as **Blockchain developer**. Moreover, in 2018, I have been certified Ethereum developer from [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). 

I program in **Solidity** and **Go**, and I have a basic knowledge of **Python**, **Javascript** and **Java**. 

On a personal note, I am a native Italian speaker, with proficiency in English, and a working knowledge of German.
