I am a third year Ph.D. student in [Cryptology and Data Security](https://crypto.unibe.ch) at University of Bern. My research interests include blockchains, distributed systems, consensus protocols and quorum systems. 
Before joining the group, I graduated in Mathematics from [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en) with a master thesis on Pairing-based Cryptography.

After that, I worked for a year and a half in [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) as Blockchain developer, where I received the certification as Ethereum developer from [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). Currently, I am working at [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com) as research intern.
