I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Cryptology and Data Security](https://crypto.unibe.ch) at University of Bern. My [research interests](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/265/5787.html) include **blockchains**, **distributed systems**, **consensus** protocols and **quorum** systems. I graduated in **Mathematics** from [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en) with a thesis on Pairing-based Cryptography. During my Ph.D. I am involved in teaching activities with my advisor Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/):

- In the fall semester of 2019 I was teaching assistant in the **Cryptography** course; 
- In the fall semester of 2020 I was teaching assistant in the Discrete Mathematics course;
- In the fall semester 2021 I was teaching assistant in the **Privacy and Data Security** course.

In summer 2021 I worked at [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com) as research intern.

Before joining the Ph.D., I worked for a year and a half at [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) as **Blockchain developer**. Moreover, in 2018, I have been certified Ethereum developer from [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). 

I program in **Solidity** and **Go**, and I have a basic knowledge of **Python**, **Javascript** and **Java**. 

I speak **Italian** (native), **English** (proficient) and **German** (beginner/intermediate).
