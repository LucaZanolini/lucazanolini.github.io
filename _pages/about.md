I am a third year Ph.D. student in Cryptology and Data Security at University of Bern. 
My research interests include blockchains, distributed systems, consensus protocols and quorum systems. 

Before joining the group, I graduated in Mathematics from [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en) (Brescia, Italy) with a master thesis on Pairing-based Cryptography. After that, I worked for a year and a half in [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) (Venice, Italy) as Blockchain developer, where I received the certification as Ethereum developer from [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). I am currently working at [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com) as research Intern.
