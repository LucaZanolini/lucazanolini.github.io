I am a research scientist at the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) where I am involved in the long-term improvements of Ethereum’s consensus protocol. My research is currently centered on studying and devising dynamically available consensus protocols, i.e., consensus protocols that support dynamic participation among network's participants. More generally, my [research interests](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/265/5787.html) include **blockchains**, **distributed systems**, and **consensus** protocols. 

I hold a PhD in [Computer Science](https://crypto.unibe.ch) from the University of Bern, where I had the privilege of conducting impactful research with Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/). My primary focus during the PhD was on working on the model of [asymmetric trust](https://boristheses.unibe.ch/4481/) in secure distributed systems and blockchains. During my PhD I was involved in various teaching activities over the past few years. In Fall 2019, I was teaching assistant for the Cryptography class, followed by Discrete Mathematics in Fall 2020. By Fall 2021, I had shifted my focus to Privacy and Data Security, and I revisited Discrete Mathematics once again in Fall 2022. Additionally, during the Summer of 2021, as a part of my PhD journey, I had the opportunity to work at [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com) as a research intern.

My academic background is rooted in Mathematics, a discipline I studied at [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://brescia.unicatt.it/facolta/scienze-matematiche-fisiche-e-naturali?rdeLocaleAttr=en) where I spiecialized in abstract algebra and cryptography.

Before joining the PhD, I worked for a year and a half at [Interlogica](https://www.interlogica.it/en/) as **Blockchain developer**. Additionally, in 2018, I became a certified Ethereum developer through [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/). 

I program in **Solidity** and **Go**, and I have a basic knowledge of **Python**, **Javascript**, and **Java**. 

On a personal note, I am a native Italian speaker, with proficiency in English, and a working knowledge of German. I hold a black belt in karate and have a deep appreciation for anime, manga, and playing video games. Additionally, I'm a proud owner of a [Corgi](https://www.instagram.com/archie_royalchonk/).
