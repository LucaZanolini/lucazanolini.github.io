We are thrilled to announce that our research paper "A Simple Single Slot Finality Protocol for Ethereum" has been accepted for presentation at the 7th International Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology - CBT 2023, held in conjunction with the European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS). 

## Event Details:

Venue: 7th International Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology

Place: The Hague, The Netherlands

Date: September 28th, 2023

Workshop Overview:
This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers in this area to carefully analyze current systems and propose new ones in order to create a scientific background for a solid development of new cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology systems.

About ESORICS:
Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research and development in computer security by establishing a European community for bringing together academia and industry in this area. Progressively organized in a series of European countries, the symposium is confirmed as one of the biggest European conferences in computer security. Nowadays, the symposium has also explored the R&D directions on AI, machine learning, privacy-enhancing technology, network security, software, and hardware security, blockchain, smart contract, and real-world applied cryptography.
