We are thrilled to announce that our research paper "Recent Latest Message Driven GHOST: Balancing Dynamic Availability With Asynchrony Resilience" has been accepted for presentation at the 37th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) 

## Event Details:

Venue: 37th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium

Place: Enschede, The Netherlands

Date: July 8th-12th, 2024

About CSF: The Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) is an annual conference for researchers in computer security, to examine current theories of security, the formal models that provide a context for those theories, and techniques for verifying security. It was created in 1988 as a workshop of the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, in response to a 1986 essay by Don Good entitled “The Foundations of Computer Security—We Need Some.” The meeting became a “symposium” in 2007, along with a policy for open, increased attendance. Over the past two decades, many seminal papers and techniques have been presented first at CSF. For more details on the history of the symposium, visit CSF's home. The program includes papers, panels, and a poster session. Topics of interest include access control, information flow, covert channels, cryptographic protocols, database security, language-based security, authorization and trust, verification techniques, integrity and availability models, and broad discussions concerning the role of formal methods in computer security and the nature of foundational research in this area.
